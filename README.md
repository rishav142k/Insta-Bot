# Insta-Bot

Basically , the idea here is to create a self automated bot that would :
1. Fire up your Firefox browser
2. Open up instagram.com and log in with your provided credentials.
3. Go to any random hashtag from the list of hashtags provided earlier in the source code.
4. Automatically likes the photos in the said hashtag.


Requirements :

1.  Python (preferably 3.5 or greater than that )
2.  geckodriver.exe , which can be downloaded from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases . Note that this exe file has to be placed in the PATH 
3.  Firefox Browser.

Libraries to be included :
    Selenium
    Random


That's it. 
Note that for this to work , specify your username and password in the code.
